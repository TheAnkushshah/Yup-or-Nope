Prerequisites

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager)

Now Follow these steps for cloning:

1. **Cloning:** Run the following command in your terminal or command prompt to clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/theankushshah/Yup-or-Nope.git
```

2. **Navigate to the Directory:** Once cloned, navigate into the project directory using the `cd` command:

```bash
cd yup-or-nope-clone
```

If you don't want to clone, instead want to create seperate, do these steps:


1. **Download ZIP Code folder:** Unzip the folder in your machine


2. **Navigate to the Downloaded Directory:** Open your code editor and open the unzipped folder in it then:

```bash
cd /path/to/downloaded/folder
```

Now Follow these steps for both cloning & download:

1. **Dependencies Installation:**

```bash
npm install
```

2. **Environment Variables & Database Setup:** Create a new file named `.env` in the root of your project and add the following content:

```env
KINDE_CLIENT_ID=
KINDE_CLIENT_SECRET=

KINDE_ISSUER_URL=
KINDE_SITE_URL=

KINDE_POST_LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL=
KINDE_POST_LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL=

DRIZZLE_DATABASE_URL=
```

(Don't get confuse by (DRIZZLE_DATABASE_URL) It's actually Neon Postgresql Database but we just named it like DRIZZLE_DATABASE_URL)
Replace the placeholder values with your actual Kinde & Database credentials. You can obtain these credentials by signing up on the [Kinde website](https://kinde.com/) and [Neon website](https://www.neon.tech/)

3. **Database Run:**

Run the following command to run the database:

```bash
npm run db:push
npm run db:studio 
```

Open [https://local.drizzle.studio](https://local.drizzle.studio) in your browser to view the database.

4. **Running:**

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the project.

5. **Start modifying:** Feel free to edit the code according to your requirements. 

6. **Testing**

```bash
npm test
```

7. **Build for Production**

```bash
npm run build
```

Now Follow these steps for both download & cloning in order to upload on github:

1. **Initialize a New Git Repository:**

```bash
git init
```

2. **Stage and Commit the Code:**

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit with downloaded code"
```

3. **Create a New Repository on GitHub:**

Note - Do NOT initialize the new repository with a README, .gitignore, or license (since the code is already downloaded & cloned, itâ€™s not needed).

4. **Link Local Repository to GitHub:**

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/new-repo.git
```

Replace https://github.com/username/new-repo.git with your actual repository URL.

5. **Push Code to GitHub:**

```bash
git branch -m main
git pull origin main
git push -u origin main
```

6. **Deployment:** Deploy the application to your preferred hosting platform to make it accessible online.


Now Follow these steps if you're forking:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Yup-or-Nope.git
```

2. **Navigate to the Directory:** Once cloned, navigate into the project directory using the `cd` command:

```bash
cd yup-or-nope
```

5. **Start Coding:** Make the additions & desired changes to the code.


3. **Commit & Push Your Changes to Your Fork:** Once cloned, navigate into the project directory using the `cd` command:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m ""
git pull origin main
git push -u origin main
```

3. **Create a Pull Request:**
